These files are also required and must be compiled in this order:
	
	ADD.vhd
	ADDER1.vhd
	ADDER2.vhd
	ALU.vhd
	ALU_tb.vhd
	ALUControl.vhd
	AND.vhd
	CPUControl.vhd
	DMEM.vhd
	FULL_ADDER.vhd
	imem_p1.vhd
	mux5_lab01_v1.vhd

	mux64_3.vhd
	mux64_lab01_v1.vhd
	PC.vhd
	ShiftLeft2_lab01_v1.vhd	
	SignExtend_lab01_v1.vhd
	pipelinedcpu0.vhd
	registers_p1.vhd
	IDEX.vhd
	EXMEM.vhd
	MEMWB.vhd
	IFID.vhd
	pipelinedcpu0_tb.vhd - USE THIS TO CHECK TEST
Testing:
	Test was done using questasim software. Simulate the file pipelinedcpu0_tb.vhd to yield results desired.
	and get the necessary waveforms
